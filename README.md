# Clone Website Style

A Python script that allows you to clone the style of any website by providing the URL of the website as input.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the repository
cd clone-website-style
3. Install the required libraries
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 ## Usage
 python clone_site_style.py https://example.com
 
The script will create a new HTML file called "cloned_site.html" in the same directory with the same style as the original website.

## Note

Please keep in mind that this script is only an example, and it might not work for all websites. Some websites might be using javascript to render their content, this script only clones the static content of the website and not the dynamic one. Also, it's not a good practice to clone a website without the permission of the website owner.
